# MitchellWoodUK.github.io
This is the website I created for my assignment two in my Web Development module in the first year. 
It is based around a local pubs website and the goal is to improve the site from the old version.

It contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as extra frameworks and a sports API.
It has the pages: Home, About, Food, Sports, Updates, and Contact.
